    <h1>What are AP Exams?</h1>
    <p>
      Advanced Placement Exams (commonly known as AP Exams) are standardized tests administered worldwide by the College Board,
      a U.S.-based "non-profit" organization that makes billions of dollars in revenue yearly. These exams were developed to
      provide a uniform measure of subject proficiency for students worldwide, regardless of their local curriculum. While
      originally intended to promote academic opportunity, AP Exams today function as a path to potential college credit and
      have become deeply embedded in the highly capitalized landscape of education.

    <h1>What do they do?</h1>
    <p>If you're on this website, chances are this is the main thing you're curious about, and the unfortunate truth is that high schools and colleges do a terrible job at explaining that.

       All universities in the United States, like High School, use a credit based system for awarding degrees. Once you
       fulfill the needed amount, you get your degree. Credits are acquired by taking courses. A degree in computer science,
       for example, might require 120 credits, with 40 required in core areas (basic skills like English, Math, Life Science),
       20 in electives (passion based courses like Art, Dance, Theology), and 60 in actual Computer Science courses (app design,
       networking, software development). 
       Many courses across universities grant 3 credits. Some courses, such as lab courses, grant more due to a higher workload,
       and some traditionally easier courses, such as music, grant less.
