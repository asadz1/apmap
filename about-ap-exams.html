    <h1>What are AP Exams?</h1>
    <p>
      Advanced Placement Exams (commonly known as AP Exams) are standardized tests administered worldwide by the College Board,
      a U.S.-based "non-profit" organization that makes billions of dollars in revenue yearly. These exams were developed to
      provide a uniform measure of subject proficiency for students worldwide, regardless of their local curriculum. While
      originally intended to promote academic opportunity, AP Exams today function as a path to potential college credit and
      have become deeply embedded in the highly capitalized landscape of education.

 <h1>What do they do?</h1>

<p>If you're on this website, chances are this is the main thing you're curious about, and the unfortunate truth is that high schools and colleges do a terrible job at explaining that.</p>

<p>All universities in the United States use a credit-based system for awarding degrees. Once you fulfill the needed amount, you get your degree. Credits are acquired by taking courses. A degree in computer science, for example, might require 120 credits, with:</p>

<ul class="bullet-list">
  <li>40 required in core areas (basic skills like English, Math, Chemistry)</li>
  <li>20 in electives (passion based courses like Art, Dance, Theology)</li>
  <li>60 in actual Computer Science courses (App design, Networking, Software development).</li>
</ul>

<p>Many courses across universities grant 3 credits, with a max of 5–6 courses allowed per semester (about 15–20 credits). Some courses, such as lab courses, grant more due to a higher workload, and some traditionally easier courses, such as music, grant less.</p>
