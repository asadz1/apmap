    <h1>What are AP Exams?</h1>
    <p>
      Advanced Placement Exams (commonly known as AP Exams) are standardized tests administered worldwide by the College Board, a U.S. based "non-profit" organization. These exams were developed to provide a uniform measure of subject proficiency for students worldwide, regardless of their local curriculum. While originally intended to promote academic opportunity, AP Exams today function as a gateway to potential college credit and have become deeply embedded in the highly commercialized and capitalistic landscape of education.
