    <h1>What are AP Exams?</h1>
    <p>
      Advanced Placement (AP) Exams are standardized tests administered globally by the College Board, a U.S. based non-profit company. Designed to evaluate a student’s mastery of college-level material, they exist to provide a consistent academic benchmark across countries, schools, and curricula, regardless of a student's educational background or location.
