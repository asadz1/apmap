    <h2>What are AP Exams?</h2>
    <p>
      Advanced Placement Exams (better known as AP Exams) are global standardized tests
      offered by the non-profit, American company Collegeboard. They are created to serve
      as a baseline examination that tests students' knowledge of different subjects,
      regardless of what country they are in or what curriculum they are taught.
